                <h2>Greetings, prospective employers</h2>
                <p>This is my portfolio, where you can find my most recent high-quality work. I am proficient in front-end web development, and I have experience in developing non-web applications. Though web design is not my preference, the web design samples show my ability to write clean, efficient code as well as my eye for detail. Continue reading below to learn more about me or jump straight into my <a href="works.html">work samples</a>.</p>

                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I have been playing video games forever, and when the notion of working in the video game industry in some capacity was presented to me, I made that my long term goal. I am constantly learning about what goes into making a game, from the artwork to the code. My horizons are broadened in the short term, and I will gladly work anywhere that I can practice my programming skills as that is the route I have chosen.</p>
                <p>I first got interested in programming in middle school, where I was exposed to things like Scratch and Code Combat. In high school, my interests shifted to graphic design; those assignments were more interesting, and the programming classes were too focused on websites for my taste. I went to college for graphic design at first, but I quickly grew a distaste for being forced to create art, so I circled back around to programming and picked up Python before studying for an Associate's Degree in Software Development at CWI.</p>

                        <p>I started learning Python in the summer of 2023, tinkering with it off and on until I reached an intermediate level. I reached the same level with C# within a school semester, and my HTML/CSS/JS knowledge is leaps and bounds ahead of where it was in high school, such that I would call myself proficient. Often during college, I have helped my classmates better understand the languages we have been learning.</p>

                        <p>In addition to learning the languages of front end development, I have experience using frameworks to jumpstart website projects and even create simple games. I used Bootstrap to create this website, but my personal favorite framework is React for its sheer potential for complex apps.</p>

                        <p>One of the less conventional skills I have learned in college is how to leverage AI to quicken my workflow and further my understanding about programming. I have learned how to write prompts that get me the answers I need to write better code in much less time than I would otherwise.</p>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>I graduated from Meridian Technical Charter High School in 2020, having taken the Design and Development Pathway. I briefly studied graphic design at BSU, took two years to reevaluate and choose a new career, and enrolled into software development at CWI. I expect to get my associate's degree in spring 2026.</p>
