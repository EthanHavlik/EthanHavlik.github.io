                <p>The Unus will launch with several games available for purchase in the online store. The following games will come pre-loaded onto every Unus, so you can enjoy the console as soon as you turn it on. Information about more games will appear on this page once they are officially announced.</p>

                        <h2>Haywire</h2>
                        <p>This is a shoot-em-up in space, but your ship's controls have been damaged, causing it to move back and forth across the screen on its own. You need to fend of the alien ships as you try to get to the repair station at the end of each level.</p>

                        <h2>Keep Jumping</h2>
                        <p>In this platformer, your character constantly runs forward, and you need to traverse the levels by jumping at the right time. You will unlock abilities that help you, and you can unlock secrets by playing earlier levels with the new abilities.</p>

                        <p>The beloved minigame from the classic Kirby Super Star on the SNES has been remade on the Unus. In a stand off against your opponent, you must press the button to attack as soon as the signal appears.</p>
