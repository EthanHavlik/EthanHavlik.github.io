                <h1>ABOUT UNUS</h1>
                <p>Unus Games is a video game publishing company and the manufacturer of the Unus console. The Unus is a video game console that only plays one-button games. The controllers only have one button that is used for game input. There are different kinds of controllers that offer different levels of comfort and different experiences when pressing the button. The Unus has games developed by our in-house studio as well as third party developers. Our goal is to push the limits of what video games can accomplish with extreme limitations.</p>

                        <h2>More about the console</h2>
                        <p>The Unus is in line with 7th-generation consoles in terms of graphical fidelity, but with the computing speed of 9th-generation consoles. The games on the system are simple, but they are highly responsive, and loading screens are few and far between. The compact package and exclusion of superfluous features keep the Unus very budget friendly - only $99.99 US with two controllers and a few pre-installed games.<br><br>
                        You may be wondering how a player can navigate menus with only one button. In all games on the Unus that have menus, tapping the button cycles to the next option, and holding it confirms the selection. There is always a back option when applicable. Being unable to pause is a limitation that developers are challenged to overcome, so you do not need to worry about it.</p>

                        <h2>Meet the Owner</h2>
                        <p>Matt "Mash" Buttons was inspired by fantasy console projects like the Pico-8 that turn out creative games with intentionally limited scope. He wanted to make such a console a reality, so he stayed up all night one night figuring out the details. He hired the publishing and manufacturing teams, acquired a factory to produce the consoles and controllers, and reached out to indie developers to form the launch library. This is the passion project of a lifetime, and we would be glad to have you join in.</p>
